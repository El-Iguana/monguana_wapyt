"""
Authentication wiring.

Two hooks, with a deliberate split of responsibility:

``authenticate``
    Runs once, at login. Verifies the password against the ``users`` table and
    returns the claims that go into the session.

``policy_hook``
    Runs before every BFF call. Reads the claims that ``authenticate`` already
    established. It does **not** re-verify the password — the session is the
    credential once login has happened.

Carried over from IguanaXterm, where getting this split backwards (verifying a
password pytincture had already stripped from the claims, on every BFF call)
is what sank the dhxpyt attempt. Login throttling is pytincture's own
(``AUTH_LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT_ATTEMPTS``, 20 per 60s per peer and per account).
